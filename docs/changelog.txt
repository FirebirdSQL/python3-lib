Version 1.4.0
=============

* Initial support for Firebird 5 (new items in `schema` and `monitor` modules).
* Finally, Firebird 4 support was added (new items in `schema` and `monitor` modules).
* Potentially breaking changes:

  - Enum `firebird.lib.monitor.ShutdownMode` was removed and replaced with
    `firebird.driver.types.ShutdownMode`. They are basically the same, but differ in value
    name ONLINE->NORMAL.
  - `~firebird.lib.schema.ObjectType` value `PACKAGE` was renamed to `PACKAGE_HEADER`

* Updated dependencies: firebird-driver>=1.9.0 and firebird-base>=1.6.1

  not hardcoded in Firebird 5, but is instead read from RDB$KEYWORDS.
